### How does Summer Math work at Worcester Tech?
You will be practicing basic skills needed for the math class that you will be taking next year by working on different skill builder problem sets.
Upon returning to Worcester Tech after the summer, your results from your Summer Math work will be given to the Math teacher you will have for the 2023-24 School year.
ALL students will redcieve a TEST grade in their MATH class upon return to school in the fall based on the completion of the Summer Math.

Any questions regarding Summer Math can be directed to Mr. Lynch. His email is: lynchse@worcesterschools.net
